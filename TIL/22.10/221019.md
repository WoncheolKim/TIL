# TIL Start
  The reasons for starting TIL are as follows.

  - To build continuous and in-depth knowledge as a developer.
  - Memories do not surpass records. So, I'm trying to organize what I've learned into a record again.
  - This is to increase work efficiency through recording and to put new ideas into practice without dwelling on them.


# Study currently in progress

  - Making a ReactJS Movie web with the Nomadcoders(ReactJS Movie web)
  - JavaScript for beginners with the Inflearn


# Think
 2022 is the most challenging year for me. I moved from Korea to Canada, and decided to become a programmer, not something I had done before. And English still bothers me. From now on, this place will be filled with records of study.
