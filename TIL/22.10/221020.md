# Think

After the boot camp, I had a lot of trouble deciding which lecture to take first. I thought that studying JavaScript from the beginner course would be a waste of time, but when I listened to the lecture, there was a part I forgot. I think it's good to start meticulously from the beginning. And I still don't know how to use TIL. Starting tomorrow, I will start teaching HTML and CSS along with JS.
